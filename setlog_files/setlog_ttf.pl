% TTF can only be called:
%  * on {log} **typechecked** state machines
%  * the state machine must have at least one invariant and one operation
%  * after the *-vc.* file has been consulted
%  * ideally once all verification conditions have been discharged
%    (not checked)

% tt means testing tree
% a tt is a tree implemented as a graph as in library(ugraphs)
% each vertex in tt is of the form [label,predicate] where
%   * label is an atom such as op_vis, op^dnf_1, op^sp_3
%   * predicate is a conjuntion of {log} atomic predicates
%     depending only on parameters, (before) state variables and
%     input variables (these are explained below)

% ts means test specification; a test specification is a predicate of a tt

% tc means test case; a test case is a conjunction of the form var = term
% where var is a variable and term is a ground term

% the following user predicates are available
%   * ttf(++spec)
%       spec is the name of the specification (an atom); the name must concide
%       with the base name of the file
%       all the remaining predicates can be executed once this one has been called
%   * applydnf(+operation) (disjunctive normal form)
%       operation is a term of the form head(I_1,...,I_n) with 0 =< n
%       head must be the name of an operation
%       I_i must be an argument to head in the state machine specification
%       I_i can't be a state variable nor a parameter
%       I_i is intended to be the an input argument to head
%       departing from the empty tt, it generates a tt such that each
%       predicate in tt is of the form
%                     axioms & precondition
%       where
%         + axioms is the conjuntion of all axioms depending on parameters appearing in
%           precondition
%         + precondition is the precondition of one conjunct of operation
%   * applysp(++label,+atom) (standard partition)
%       label is a label in the current tt
%       the current tt results from a previous call to some tactic
%       atom is a term representing an atomic predicate appearing in the
%       operation (RQ are considered atomic); variable names used in atom must coincide
%       with those used in the operation and there must be at least one IS variable; if
%       no variable in IS appears in atom the it will match with an atom with no
%       variable in IS and by using unification 
%       modifies the current tt by applying standard partition on atom to all
%         vertices of the subtree of the current tt whose root is label
%   * applyst(++label,+var) (sum type)
%       label is a label in the current tt
%       var is an input variable of a sum type
%       the current tt results from a previous call to some tactic
%       partitions all vertices of the subtree of the current tt whose root is label
%       with ts of the form var = c where c is a constructor of the sum type
%       c can have arguments
%   * applyii(++label,+var,++list) (integer interval)
%       label is a label in the current tt
%       var is an input variable of type int
%       list is a list of integer numbers
%       the current tt results from a previous call to some tactic
%       applyii sorts list
%       partitions all vertices of the subtree of the current tt whose root is label
%       with ts of the form var < i, var = i, i < var < j where i and j are in list
%   * applysc(++label,+var) (set cardinality)
%       label is a label in the current tt
%       var is an input variable of some set type
%       the current tt results from a previous call to some tactic
%       partitions all vertices of the subtree of the current tt whose root is label
%       with ts of the form:
%       V = {}, V = {X} & dec(X,T), V = {X,Y/W} & X neq Y & dec([X,Y],T) & dec(W,set(T))
%   * applyex(++label,+ex) (set cardinality)
%       label is a label in the current tt
%       ex is an exists/2 predicate where the quantification domain is either an
%       input variable or its tail is an input variable, of some set type
%       the current tt results from a previous call to some tactic
%       partitions all vertices of the subtree of the current tt whose root is label
%       with ts of the form:
%       V = {X} & dec(X,T), V = {X,Y/W} & X neq Y & dec([X,Y],T) & dec(W,set(T)),
%       V = {NegX,Y/W} & NegX neq Y & NegPred & dec([NegX,Y],T) & dec(W,set(T))
%       where NegPred is the result of negating the predicate of ex instantiated
%       at NegX.
%   * prunett(++timeout,++exec_opt)
%       the current tt results from a previous call to some tactic
%       timeout is a positive natural number that will be passed as timeout to setlog/5
%       exec_opt is a list of execution options that will be passed as the fifth argument
%         to setlog/5
%       the current tt is modified by pruning unsatisfiable leaves from it
%   * prunett/0
%       as prunett/2 where timeout and exec_opt are set by this program to some
%       fixed values
%   * gentc(++timeout,++exec_opt)
%       the current tt results from a previous call to some tactic
%       timeout is a positive natural number that will be passed as timeout to setlog/5
%       exec_opt is a list of execution options that will be passed as the fifth argument
%         to setlog/5; nogrounsol isn't accepted as an option; groundsol is added to
%         exec_op if not present
%       the current tt is modified by adding test cases to the satisfiable
%         leaves and adding a special vertex "timeout" to those leaves where the
%         call to setlog/5 finished in timeout
%   * gentc/0
%       as gentc/2 where timeout and exec_opt are set by this program to some
%       fixed values
%   * writett/0
%       the current tt results from a previous call to some tactic or gentc
%       writes the labels the current tt's nodes using indentation
%   * writetc(++label)
%       the current tt iresults from a previous call to gentc
%       label must be the label of a test case in the current tt
%       writes the corresponding test case
%   * writetc/0
%       the current tt results from a previous call to gentc
%       writes all the test cases of the current tt
%   * exporttt/0
%       the current tt results from a previous call to some tactic or gentc
%       saves test specifications in a file named spec-tt.pl 
%       (where spec is the value passed to ttf/1)
%       spec-tt.pl is a list of clauses of the form
%         label(V_1,...,V_n) :- predicate.
%       where * label is a label of a leaf ts or a tc in the current tt 
%             * V_i are the variables appearing in predicate
%             * predicate is the conjunction of all the predicates of the
%               nodes of the path from root to the leaf ts, or the tc
%       so clauses represent either leaf ts' or tc's
%
% in this way a typical use of TTF is as follows:
%   ttf(spec) -> applydnf(op) -> applysp(l,a) -> ... -> applysp(l,a) ->
%   gentc, and then one can either write or export the current tt or its test
%   specifications and test cases
